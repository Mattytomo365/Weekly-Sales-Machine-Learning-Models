# Weekly Sales Machine Learning Models

---

## Overview

This project predicts weekly sales for retail stores using machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training/testing of models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors.

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and converts date columns to datetime format.
- **Feature Engineering**: Adds holiday and date-based features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Implements Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation**: Calculates metrics like Weighted MAE, RMSE, and R² for model performance.
- **Predictions**: Outputs final predictions for test datasets.
